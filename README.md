# ZTM Academy - Final Project: SmartBrain Back-End

This repository is for the web server (back-end) of the [web application](https://github.com/jstran97/ztm-smartbrain/tree/main). It was constructed using Express.js and PostgreSQL.

# Getting Started:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. You must add your own `API key / Personal Access Token (PAT)` in the `controllers/image.js` file to connect to Clarifai API
5. Add your own database credentials to server.js line 11

You can grab Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)

Make sure you use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL for this codebase.
